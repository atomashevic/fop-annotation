# Face of Populism Image Annotation Code & Dataset

## Repository structure

- `analysis/` folder has scripts for running the code comparing human coders to ML output
- `figures/` folder has figures generated by the scripts in `analysis/` folder
- `fop/` folder has images selected for the annotation task
- `results/` folder has CSV files exported by the coding task and the results of the ML model

## Run annotation study

In order to run the annotation task:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `setup.R`
3. Run `run.R` to start the Shiny app

## Run the analysis on existing annotated data

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `analysis/main.R` to get the results on agreement of human coders and ML in all cases where majority vote consensus is possible
3. Run `analysis/face-only.R` to get the results where we both have the majority vote and majority of humans and ML agrees that face is visible on the frame
