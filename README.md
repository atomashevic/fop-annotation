# Face of Populism Image Annotation Code & Dataset

## Repository structure

- `analysis/` folder contains scripts for running the code comparing human coders to ML output
- `figures/` folder contains figures generated by the scripts in the `analysis/` folder
- `fop/` folder contains images selected for the annotation task
- `results/` folder contains CSV files exported by the coding task and the results of the ML model

## Running the annotation study

To run the annotation task:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `setup.R`
3. Run `run.R` to start the Shiny app

## Running the analysis on existing annotated data

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `analysis/main.R` to obtain results on the agreement between human coders and ML in all cases where a majority vote consensus is possible
3. Run `analysis/face-only.R` to obtain results for cases where both a majority vote is available and the majority of humans and ML agree that a face is visible in the frame
